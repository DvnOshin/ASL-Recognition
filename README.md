# American Sign Language Recognition Using Deep Learning
In this project, we are using OpenCV along with the MediaPipe library, which detects face and hand landmarks and a deep-learning model LSTM, which is used in sequence prediction problems. The trained model takes in the video sequences and correctly recognizes the hand sign gesture by displaying it on the screen in the form of text with an accuracy of 86%.
